\section{Conclusion}

While SMC has found its use also in the white-box setting as a scalable alternative, we introduce the first approach that utilizes the knowledge in a local way, without globally processing the state space, and thus preserves the efficency advantages of black-box SMC.
We call this approach grey SMC since we utilize only the topological information and not the quantitative information (sometimes referred to as grey box).
On the one hand, this is useful as the quantitative information is often unavailable or imprecise w.r.t.\ the modelled reality.
On the other hand, while the full quantitative information is irrelevant in BSCCs, it plays a major role in the transient phase and could be used to further enhance the approach. For instance, it could be used for importance sampling in order to handle rare events efficiently \cite{DBLP:conf/cav/JegourelLS12,DBLP:conf/setta/BuddeDH17} even in the context of unbounded-horizon properties.
