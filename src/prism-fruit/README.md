- Follow [this](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/games/installation.php), also using the following command: `./configure --with-java=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk --enable-interfaces=java`
- Take care to use Java 8
- Make sure all necessary libraries are in 'lib' folder.
- Replace the `ext` folder with one from some other installation
- Add `ppl_java.jar` (located in `/usr/local/lib/ppl/ppl_java.jar`) to `lib` (seems optional)
- For benchmarking, `pip install pueue` with python3
